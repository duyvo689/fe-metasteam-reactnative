## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Minimum React version for Replay is 16.6. Additionally, one component, the [CompoundVideoStreamer](https://vimond.github.io/replay/#/advanced-playback/adaptive-streaming#enabling-playback-for-multiple-streaming-technologies-based-on-stream-technology-resolution), requires your script bundler to support dynamic `import()` statements. This only applies if this component is actually inserted in your code.

### Inserting Replay into your React app

#### Installing the Replay npm package

```sh
npm install vimond-replay --save
```

#### Importing dependencies

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/index.css';
```

The last CSS `import` statement might be substituted with your desired CSS inclusion mechanism, e.g. SASS.

#### Rendering the Replay player with a progressive video source (MP4 file)

```jsx
class MyAppView extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Replay source="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"/>
    );
  }
}
```

Flow and TypeScript static type annotations/declarations are provided for the Replay component.
